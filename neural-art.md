A few months ago, a pretty interesting machine learning [paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf) was published. The authors of this paper trained a neural network to simulate the style of one picture on top of the content of another picture. If you read the paper they got some pretty interesting results. Since this capability was added to MXNet, a relatively new deep learning framework I've been learning, I decided to try it out on a picture I took this summer of the Colosseum.
